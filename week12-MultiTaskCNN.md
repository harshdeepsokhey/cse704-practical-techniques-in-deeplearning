### Problem Statement & Main Contributions
- This paper introduces a CNN framework where each CNN handles a particular task associated with an attribute. The latent representations generated by each of the CNN is combined into one shared latent feature matrix, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$L$" title="$L$" /> , that allows sharing of attribute knowledge among similar groups for better prediction. 

- The main contribution of the authors is the using the implementation of the latent task matrix to generated a shared latent matrix with all the different attribute features combined and capable of sharing knowledge among similar groups. 

### Related Work (Key Papers)
- The paper is heavily inspired from [Zhou et.al](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~qzhao/publications/pdf/mtl_iccv13.pdf) that discusses the latent task matrix generation.
   
### Asumptions and Future Work
- One of the key assumptions in the paper is that sharing of knowledge amongst similar groups should be encouraged and discouraged among dissimilar groups.
